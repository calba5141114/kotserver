### Kotlin Server 
I am experimenting with writing web servers in 
Kotlin as to leverage the power of the JVM with
a Modern syntax and seamless interoperability with 
Java.

### Future Plans with JVM
I am going to spend time getting 
familiar with Scala and Java in order 
to understand the advantages and disadvantages
of each language. 

### Scala 
I plan on using Scala along with 
Apache Spark for dealing with and Streaming 
big data. 

### Java 
I am going to utilize Java for 
building embedded systems and just 
to toy with (light use)

### Developer Background 
I am familiar with tools like Docker, Kubernetes
and have programmed servers for years using languages 
like Python, Node.js and Other Scripting languages. 

### Other 
I plan on diving heavily into using tools 
like Golang, Elixir, Rust and other langauges 
for creating web servers
